- 👋 Hi, I’m David but also known as DT to many.  
- 👀 I’m interested in Oracle Cloud and web services and how to make use of this technology to create solutions.  I have many years experience 
as a solutions architect, business & technology consultant.  I am always looking for new challenges and ways to create solutions to business and technical problems.   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about machine learning with a particular interest in Tiny ML.  I have also recently completed a personal learning project to take a small web site solution 
developed in Flask and SQL Lite and migrating to a solution running on an Oracle cloud ("Compute") service connected to an Oracle cloud automatonomous Database using REST
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that use either web services, Machine Learning or specifically Tiny ML.
